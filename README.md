# 👋 Hi, I'm SteinerML

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a relentless problem-solver and automation enthusiast, passionate about building robust, future-proof data extraction and AI-driven solutions. My approach is defined by a deep attention to detail, a drive for maintainability, and a love for tackling the "hard parts" of real-world automation.

## 🏆 What Sets Me Apart

- **Precision & Pickiness:** I ask the tough questions, challenge assumptions, and never settle for "good enough." My solutions are designed to handle edge cases and future changes.
- **Technical Depth:** I dive deep into extraction logic, robust chunking, and dynamic association—always comparing and improving algorithms for reliability.
- **Documentation & Communication:** I believe in clear, visual documentation (markdown tables, ASCII diagrams, Q&A) to make complex processes transparent and defensible.
- **Performance & Realism:** I synchronize timing logic for human-like automation, measure performance, and ensure workflows are both efficient and natural.
- **Modularity & Maintainability:** My code is modular, reusable, and easy to refactor—ready for whatever comes next.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Interests

- **Python** (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, regex, data parsing)
- **Automation & Web Scraping**
- **AI & NLP** (prompt engineering, LLM integration)
- **Data Engineering** (chunking, cropping, dynamic extraction)
- **Testing, Refactoring, and Performance Measurement**

## 💡 What Drives Me

- Building resilient, adaptable code for messy, real-world data
- Making complex automation workflows robust and maintainable
- Collaborating on advanced extraction, AI, and automation challenges
